Built a full Windows Server Active Directory lab in Hyper-V following an end-to-end AD DS deployment, including domain controller promotion, DNS configuration, and domain networking. Designed and organized an OU hierarchy to support structured identity management and user separation.

Extended the lab by developing a custom PowerShell automation solution for Active Directory user provisioning. Implemented a script leveraging the ActiveDirectory module (New-ADUser) and execution policy management to create users programmatically within specific Organizational Units. Additionally, built a lightweight PowerShell Windows Forms GUI that collects user attributes (first name, last name, username, password) and allows selection of the target OU via a dropdown, enabling controlled and repeatable account creation without manual ADUC interaction.
